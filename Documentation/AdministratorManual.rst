Installation
=============

* How should the extension be installed?
* Are they dependencies to resolve?
* Is it a static template file to be included?

Example of sentence:

Install the extension as normal in the Extension Manager. After activating the extension you just have to include the static TypoScript template provided by the extension.

The constants editor then provides options to modify the default values for Open Graph tags. These options include:

* the default title
* the default site name
* the default type
* the default image
* the default description
* the default admins

Furthermore the constants editor provides a possibility to set an image used as watermark on every image used for an og:image tag.
