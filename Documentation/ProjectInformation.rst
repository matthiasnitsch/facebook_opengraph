To Do
-----------

Actually there are a few plans to improve the extension. Including the option to setup fallback values as default OG meta-tags or providing watermarks for images (i.e. company logos).

Furthermore this extension will develop towards TYPO3 6.x including FAL. Bugs for older versions wil get fixed, but for new features the actual version of TYPO3 will be the one to go with.
